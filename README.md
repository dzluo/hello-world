# hello-world
I am here to learning programming. For the past years, I have learnt matlab, c, verilog, python.
I'm familiar with matlab. Although matlab is doing very well in scientific caculation, it is not really very good at some others like gui, web, embeded. 
Computer science change the world faster in the past years and I need to learning this knowledge to not noly learn better of the world, bust also to make my career mare successly.
That's all.
