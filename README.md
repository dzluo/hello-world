# hello-world
I am here to learning programming. For the past years, I have learnt matlab, c, verilog, python.

I'm familiar with matlab. Although matlab is doing very well in scientific caculation, it is not really very good at some others like gui, web, embeded. 

Computer science changes the world faster in the past years and I need to learning this knowledge to not only learn better of the world, but also make my career more successful.

That's all.
